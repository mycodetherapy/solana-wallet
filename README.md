## Project solana-wallet

## This mobile app allows you to create solana crypto wallets and sol transactions.

### If you want to run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository from the main branch to your device. To do this, type `git clone <repository address>` in the terminal.
2. In the terminal, go to the project folder and install the dependencies `npm install`.
3. Start the project with the `npm run dev` command.

### If you want to run the app on a mobile device:

1. The application must be running locally on your computer (see instructions above). By default, the application runs on port 3000.
2. You need to establish a network connection between the PC and the mobile device. By any method, such as FTP.
3. You need to find out the ip address of your computer. You can do this by entering the `ipconfig` command in the terminal.
4. On a mobile device, go to the browser and enter the IP address of the computer and the port on which the application is running. For example, `192.162.0.110:3000` and go to that address.

In the app, you can go to the wallet section and create two solana wallets.
When you create a wallet, you will immediately get access to 1 sol (that's a little bonus from me))
In the transactions section, you can make transfers of sol to other solana crypto wallets.

Happy using!
